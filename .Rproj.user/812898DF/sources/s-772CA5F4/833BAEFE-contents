# Methods

We describe our methods in this chapter.

Begin by collecting the block group data data and converting it to lat and lon
```{r}

#download data from the census website
bgcentroid <- read.csv("C:/Users/stuck/Documents/Transpo Research/Grocery Stores/For GIS/Block Group Centroid.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

lat <- bgcentroid[["LATITUDE"]]
lon <- bgcentroid[["LONGITUDE"]]

```

Then, we collect data for grocery stores and convert that data to lat and lon. This data comes from ArcGIS
```{r}

```
