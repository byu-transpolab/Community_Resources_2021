# Introduction {#intro}

Communities provide important resources to their members, and spatial exclusion
from these resources can negatively affect both subjective measures of well-being 
[@currie2010modeling] and economic opportunity.
Measuring good or poor access to these resources is an important concern. But
access involves more than merely distance or travel impedance: it is a function
of the quality of the resource, and how many options for the resource are
available.

In this paper, we consider utility-based access to parks, grocery stores, and
libraries in Utah County, Utah. The utility preferences are estimated on
location-based services data obtained from a third-party commercial data
aggregator. We then use the model estimates to construct a composite
accessibility measure and compare the measure with neighborhood-level
sociodemographic characteristics. 

The paper begins with a discussion of previous attempts to evaluate 
access to community resources. We then describe the methodology employed in 
this research, which makes use of novel third-party datasets
