## Destination Choice Models

Using the simulated trip choices assembled from the location-based services data,
we estimate destination choice models with the `mlogit` package for 
R [@R; @mlogit].

```{r park-models}
tar_load(park_models)
park_map = c(
    "duration_CAR" = "Drive time",
    "mclogsum" = "Mode Choice Logsum",
    "yj_acres" = "log(Acres)",
    "playgroundTRUE" = "Playground",
    "splashpadTRUE"  = "Splashpad",
    "volleyballTRUE" = "Volleyball",
    "basketballTRUE" = "Basketball",
    "tennisTRUE" = "Tennis"
)

modelsummary(park_models, estimate = "{estimate}({statistic}){stars}", 
             title = "Park Destination Choice Utilities",
             stars = c('*' = .05, '**' = .01),
             coef_map = park_map, gof_map = gm,
             statistic = NULL, note = "t-statistics in parentheses. * p < 0.5, ** p < 0.1") %>%
  landscape()
ls_v_attr <- lrtest(park_models$Attributes, park_models$`All - Logsum`)
ls_v_car <- horowitz_lrtest(park_models$`All - Logsum`, park_models$`All - Car`)
```

Table \@ref(tab:park-models) presents the model estimation results for 
five different specifications of park destination choice. The "Car" model
includes only the network travel time by car as a predictor of park choice; 
the "MCLS" model similarly contains only the mode choice logsum as an 
impedance term. The signs on the coefficient indicate that people are more
likely to choose parks with lower car distance or higher multi-modal access, all
else equal. The "Attributes" model includes only information on the park attributes
including size and amenities. On balance, people appear attracted to larger parks
and parks with playgrounds, while somewhat deterred by various sports facilities. 
The "All" models include both the relevant travel impedance term as well as
destination attributes. A 

For most block group-park pairs, the transit and walk travel disutilities
are sufficiently high that choosing these travel modes is unlikely. As a
result, the mode choice logsum is highly collinear with the car travel time.
Nevertheless, there are small differences differences between the models 
with the different impedance terms. Using a non-nested likelihood statistic 
test presented by HOROWITZ, we can reject the null hypothesis that the two 
"All" models have equivalent likelihood ($p$-value of `r ls_v_car`), and infer
that the mode choice logsum is a marginally better estimator of park choice than
the vehicle travel time alone.

```{r grocery-models}
tar_load(grocery_models)

grocery_map = c(
    "duration_CAR" = "Drive time",
    "mclogsum" = "Mode Choice Logsum",
    "typeConvenience Store" = "Convenience Store",
    "typeOther (Write in a description)" = "Other non-standard",
    "pharmacyTRUE" = "Has pharmacy",
    "ethnicTRUE" = "Ethnic market",
    "merchTRUE" = "Has other merchandise",
    "registers" = "Number of registers",
    "selfchecko" = "Number of self-checkout"
  )

modelsummary(grocery_models, 
             estimate = "{estimate}({statistic}){stars}",  statistic = NULL, 
             title = "Grocery Destination Choice Utilities",
             stars = c('*' = .05, '**' = .01), coef_map = grocery_map, gof_map = gm,
             note = "t-statistics in parentheses. * p < 0.5, ** p < 0.1") %>%
  landscape()
ls_v_car_g <- horowitz_lrtest(grocery_models$`All - Logsum`, grocery_models$`All - Car`)
d_conv_ratio <- grocery_models$`All - Car`$coefficients["typeConvenience Store"] / 
  grocery_models$`All - Car`$coefficients["duration_CAR"]  
```

Table \@ref(tab:grocery-models) presents the model estimation results for the grocery 
store models. As with the parks models in Table \@ref(tab:park-models), the 
most predictive model contains both a travel impedance term and attributes of
the destination grocery store. The number of registers suggests that people 
prefer larger stores, all else equal; ethnic markets, convenience stores, and other
facilities are less preferred while stores with pharmacies and other merchandise
(clothes, home goods, etc.) attract visitors. The ratio of the drive time and 
convenience store coefficients suggests that on average, people are willing to 
drive `r d_conv_ratio` minutes to reach a store that is not a convenience store.
In terms of the travel impedance, there is not a sufficiently large gap in the
model likelihoods to reject that the mode choice logsum and the drive 
time are equivalent predictors of grocery store choice.

```{r library-models}
tar_load(library_models)

library_map <- c(
    "duration_CAR" = "Drive time",
    "mclogsum" = "Mode Choice Logsum",
    "classesTRUE" = "Offers Classes",
    "genealogyTRUE" = "Genealogy Resources"
)

modelsummary(library_models, estimate = "{estimate}({statistic}){stars}", 
             title = "Library Destination Choice Utilities",
             stars = c('*' = .05, '**' = .01),
             coef_map = library_map, gof_map = gm,
             statistic = NULL, note = "t-statistics in parentheses. * p < 0.5, ** p < 0.1") %>%
  landscape()
ls_v_car_l <- horowitz_lrtest(library_models$`All - Logsum`, library_models$`All - Car`)
```

Table \@ref(tab:library-models) presents the model estimation results for the 
library destination choice models. As with parks and grocery stores, both 
travel impedance and destination attributes are significant predictors of 
library choice. In this case, however, the library attributes provide very little
predictive power of library choice. This is perhaps because virtually all 
libraries in the dataset offer the same set of basic amenities, but also because 
each municipality in Utah County tends to operate its own library rather than 
having a system of interconnected library branches as might be typical in 
larger cities or other regions. Additionally, there is no significant difference
between the prediction power of the mode choice logsum versus the car travel 
time.
