# Limitations

The location-based services data reveals the likely home location of devices 
observed within a geographic polygon, within some measurement error. 
It cannot tell us whether the device holder actually accomplished the assumed
activity; that is, there may be a reason why a device was observed near a
library even though the person did not actually patronize the library.
Additionally, the method we use to compile the estimation dataset presumes that
the choice to make a trip to the community resource has already been made. Though
it can suggest how the accessibility of a neighborhood to these resource would improve 
were transportation impedance decreased or the resources expanded or improved, 
it cannot tell us how many more people might take advantage of the resource 
in that case.
