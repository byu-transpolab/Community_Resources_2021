<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Modeling Framework<a href="methods.html#framework" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In a destination choice modeling framework <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-recker1978" role="doc-biblioref">Recker and Kostyniuk, 1978</a>)</span>, an individual
at origin <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> considering a destination <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> from a set of possible destinations
<span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> has a choice probability
<span class="math display" id="eq:mnlp">\[\begin{equation}
P_{ij} = \frac{e^{V_{ij}}}{\sum_{j&#39; \in J} e^{V_{ij&#39;}}}
  \tag{3.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(V_{ij}\)</span> is a linear-in-parameters function representing the utility of
destination <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. The destination utility consists of two basic elements:
<span class="math display" id="eq:dcu">\[\begin{equation}
V_{ij} = \beta t_{ij} + X_j\gamma
  \tag{3.2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(t_{ij}\)</span> is a measure of the travel impedance between <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span>
is a vector of attributes of destination <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta, \gamma\)</span> are estimated
parameters relating the travel impedance and the destination attributes to the
utility. These parameters may be estimated by maximum likelihood given sufficient
observational data.</p>
<p>The logarithm of the denominator of the choice probability given in Equation
<a href="methods.html#eq:mnlp">(3.1)</a> is a quantity called the <em>logsum</em> and represents the total
value — or accessibility <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> — of the choice set for individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-handy1997" role="doc-biblioref">Handy and Niemeier, 1997</a>; <a href="#ref-williams1977formation" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 1977</a>)</span>
<span class="math display" id="eq:dclogsum">\[\begin{equation}
A_i = \log\left(\sum_{j&#39; \in J} e^{V_{ij&#39;}}\right) + C
  \tag{3.3}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is an unknown constant resulting from the fact that the utility
represented in Equation <a href="methods.html#eq:dcu">(3.2)</a> is not absolute, but rather relative to
the utilities of the other options. The difference in logsum values between two
different origin points could be compared to determine which location has “better”
accessibility to the destinations in question, based on the elements included
in Equation <a href="methods.html#eq:dcu">(3.2)</a>. Accessibility might be improved by lower travel
impedance, or by improved amenities, or even by simply having more options available.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="methods.html#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">tar_load</span>(utilities)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These other elements include attributes of the community resource relevant to
the destination choice problem: the size of the resource, amenities available,
the price of goods on sale, etc. Each of these variables has an
importance weighted against the travel impedance <span class="math inline">\(t_{ij}\)</span>, which might take
various forms depending on the data available and the destination resource in
question.</p>
<p>Simple measures such as the highway travel time or the walk distance
might be more or less appropriate for particular resources. Another option
commonly used in travel demand models is actually the logsum of a <em>mode</em>
choice model with the utility of choosing each mode given by a set of utility
equations. In this study we adopt generic mode choice utility equations
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  V_{ij\mathrm{auto}} &amp;= -0.028* (t_{ij\mathrm{auto}})\\
  V_{ij\mathrm{transit}} &amp;= -4 -0.028* (t_{ij\mathrm{transit}})
    -0.056* (wt_{ij}) -0.372*(at_{ij})\\
  V_{ij\mathrm{walk}} &amp;= -5 -0.028* (t_{ij\mathrm{walk}})
    -1.12* (d_{ij} | d_{ij} &lt; 1.5)  
    -5.58* (d_{ij} | d_{ij} \geq 1.5)
\end{align*}\]</span><br />
where <span class="math inline">\(t_{ij}\)</span> is the travel time in minutes from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> by each mode
(including only in-vehicle time for transit), <span class="math inline">\(wt\)</span> is the transit wait and
transfer time, <span class="math inline">\(at\)</span> is the time to access and egress transit by walking, and <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span>
is the walking distance in miles. The walking distance uses two different
utility parameters depending on whether the walking distance is greater than 1.5
miles. The travel impedance logsum between <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is then
<span class="math display" id="eq:mcls">\[\begin{equation}
MCLS_{ij} = \log\left(\exp(V_{ij\mathrm{auto}}) + \exp(V_{ij\mathrm{transit}}) + \exp(V_{ij\mathrm{walk}}) \right)
  \tag{3.4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>

<p>Utah County, Utah, is among the fastest-growing urbanized regions in the United
States, with formerly agrarian areas and open rangeland being converted to
predominately suburban built environments. The population and economic center of
the county is in Provo and Orem, home to two large universities (Brigham Young
and Utah Valley), but the most rapid development in commercial and residential
terms has been in communities north of Utah Lake, between Provo and Salt Lake
City to the north. Interstate 15 travels the spine of the county, and a commuter
rail system travels multiple times a day between Provo and Salt Lake City with
stations in Orem, American Fork, and Lehi. A bus rapid transit (BRT) system connects
the universities, two commuter rail stations, and the densest portions of Provo
and Orem, and other local bus services operate in other communities in the region.
Table <a href="methods.html#tab:acstable">3.1</a> presents descriptive statistics of
the block groups in Utah County obtained from the 2015-2019 American Community
Survey (ACS) using the tidycensus package for R <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tidycensus" role="doc-biblioref">Walker and Herman, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

Figure 3.1: Location of community resources in Utah County
</p>
</div>
<div id="resource-data" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Resource Data<a href="methods.html#resource-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Figure <a href="methods.html#fig:utco-map">3.1</a> shows the locations of three types of
community resources in Utah County: parks, grocery stores, and libraries.
For each resource, an initial list of resources and elementary attributes was
obtained by executing a relevant query to OpenStreetMap (OSM).</p>
<p>Public parks and their attributes retrieved from OSM were verified and
corrected using aerial imagery and some site visits. The attributes included
the size of the park in acres, whether the park includes a playground, and
whether the park includes facilities for volleyball, basketball, and tennis.
The constructed dataset includes 582 attributed parks.</p>
<p>Grocery stores were retrieved from OSM and validated using internet resources and
site visits. The complete Nutritional Environment Measures Survey (NEMS-S) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-glanz2007" role="doc-biblioref">Glanz et al., 2007</a>)</span>
was collected for each store, but this preliminary analysis only includes
cursory information on the stores including whether the store is a convenience store
or some other non-traditional grocery, whether the store includes a pharmacy or
other non-food merchandise, and the number of registers as a measure of the
store’s size. The constructed dataset includes 58 stores.</p>
<p>Libraries were retrieved from OSM, and validated using library websites and
some site visits. The initial query returned university libraries and other
specialty resources; though some of these libraries are open to those outside
the university community, these were removed so that the resource list only
includes libraries generally catering to the general public. The amenities
available include whether the library offers additional classes and programs,
and whether the library includes genealogical or family history resources. The
square footage of the library was estimated from online mapping services.
Other variables discussed in the literature such as the availability of computers
and public wi-fi networks were present in every library and therefore cannot
be included in the destination utility equations.</p>

<div id="mobile-device-data" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Mobile Device Data<a href="methods.html#mobile-device-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="citation">Macfarlane et al. (<a href="#ref-alamedaparks" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> present a method for estimating destination choice models from
such data, which we repeat in this study. We provided a set of geometric
polygons for each park, grocery store, and library to StreetLight Data, Inc., a
commercial aggregator. StreetLight Data in turn provided data on the number of
mobile devices observed in each polygon grouped by the inferred residence block
group of of those devices during summer and fall 2019.
We then created a simulated destination choice estimation dataset for each
community resource by sampling 10,000 block group - resource “trips” from the
StreetLight dataset. This created a “chosen” alternative; we then sampled ten additional
resources at random (each simulated trip was paired with a different sample) to
serve as the non-chosen alternatives. Random sampling of alternatives is a
common practice that results in unbiased estimates, though the standard errors
of the estimates might be larger than could be obtained through a more carefully
designed sampling scheme <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-train2009" role="doc-biblioref">Train, 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="travel-times" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Travel Times<a href="methods.html#travel-times" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Once the choice, alternatives, and attributes of the alternatives have been
defined, the last element of the choice utility is the travel impedance between
each block group and each resource. Using the <code>r5r</code> R interface <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-r5r" role="doc-biblioref">Rafael H. M. Pereira et al., 2021</a>)</span> to the R5
routing algorithm, we estimated the highway drive travel time, the walking
route time, and the transit travel time for trips departing on April 26,
2022 at 8 AM. The time and date are most relevant for the transit path builder
in R5, which uses detailed transit path information stored in the
Utah Transit Authority GTFS feed file for Spring and Summer 2022. The transit path contains
separate measures of the total travel time, the time in the transit vehicle,
transfer time, and access / egress time, allowing us full use of the
mode choice utility equations and resulting logsum described in Equation <a href="methods.html#eq:mcls">(3.4)</a>.
We limited valid paths to those involving less than 10 km of walking and
2 hours of total travel time.</p>
<p>For groceries and libraries, we queried the shortest time path on each
mode from the population-weighted block group centroid to the centroid of the grocery
store or library polygon. Because some parks in the dataset can be relatively
large and the centroid might be far from the park access or use point, we instead
sampled points along the boundary of the park polygon, and queried the shortest
time path by each mode to the nearest boundary point.</p>
