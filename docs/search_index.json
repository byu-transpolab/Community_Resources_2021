This section first discusses research developing and classifying various accessibility measures, followed by a discussion of previous attempts to measure access to the resources selected for this analysis. 2.1 Developing Access Measures Accessibility is easily defined as the ability to reach useful destinations (Handy and Niemeier, 1997), but this ease in definition belies a wide array of potential quantitative descriptions. Dong et al. (2006) present a helpful hierarchy of access measures, which we briefly summarize here. Among the simplest measures of access is a so-called isochrone measure, which considers whether a person at position \\(i\\) traveling to a potential destination \\(j\\) is within a particular travel time threshold \\(t^*\\). Using this measure, a person has access to the resource if \\(t_{ij} &lt; t_*\\). Sometimes it is possible to access multiple resources within this threshold, in which case a more continuous score can be defined as \\[\\begin{equation} A_i^{\\mathrm{isochrone}} = \\sum_{j \\in J} \\delta_{ij}, \\mathrm{\\ where\\ } \\delta_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\text{for } t_{ij} \\leq t^*\\\\ 0, &amp; \\text{for } t_{ij} &gt; t^* \\end{cases} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Variations of this measure include elements like “number of grocery stores within 10 minutes” or “density of green space within 5 miles.” Strengths of this method are its relative simplicity, but it has three central limitations. First, the threshold \\(t^*\\) must be defined by the researcher for a specific value by a certain travel mode, and different definitions can have different policy outcomes (Logan et al., 2019). Second, the binary nature of the measure belies our understanding of behavior: a four minute and fifty second trip is not functionally different from a five minute and ten second trip. Finally, the measure assumes that all options in the choice set \\(J\\) are of equivalent quality. Extensions to this basic framework relax some of these constricting assumptions. A gravity model accessibility measure \\[\\begin{equation} A_i^{\\mathrm{gravity}} = \\sum_{j \\in J} S_j * f(t_{ij}, \\beta) \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] considers the “size” of the destination \\(S_j\\) as well as a continuous travel impedance function that decreases the impact of further destinations. The parameters of this impedance function can be calibrated to match the observed trip length distribution of a survey or other data, or a basic distance decay function without parameters can be used. Additionally, if no other information on the “size” or attractiveness of the destinations is available, then \\(S_j = 1\\). Activity-based or utility-based measures rely on location choice theory, where the probability of choosing a destination is a function of the destination’s attributes weighted against the travel impedance to reach it. The mathematical details of this measure are described below in Section 3.1, but the measure relies on understanding how the attributes of a destination \\(X_j\\) affect the utility \\(V_{ij}\\) of a person at origin \\(i\\) selecting that destination \\[\\begin{equation} V_{ij} = X_{ij}\\beta \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] One potential obstacle to developing utility-based accessibility measures is obtaining sufficient data on which to estimate the utility preference parameters \\(\\beta\\). High-quality household surveys that reveal activity locations are most commonly used for this purpose in general travel demand modeling, but such surveys typically group many infrequent discretionary trips into catch-all categories (Cambridge Systematics, 2012). In the last several years, various commercial data products developed from mobile device and location-based services (LBS) data have entered common use in transportation planning activities. Applications or websites that serve mobile content based on a user’s location will log this location information and sell the data to commercial third-party aggregators. These aggregators in turn will weight and anonymize the data before selling the prepared datasets to transportation planning agencies. These LBS datasets typically contain vehicle or person flows between spatially defined zones, sometimes segmented by inferred transportation mode, time of day, day of week, or imputed trip purpose. These datasets have been shown to accurately reflect visits to recreation areas and other land uses (Monz et al., 2019), and are becoming a common part of transportation planning practice (Naboulsi et al., 2016; Zalewski et al., 2019). In recent years, researchers have begun developing methods to estimate destination choice models (and their related utility parameters) from passive data. Zhu and Ye (2018) developed a method to estimate a destination choice model for taxi trips in Shanghai, relying on the scale of the GPS dataset to estimate a robust model. Macfarlane et al. (2021) use location-based services data for park visitors in Alameda County, California to estimate a destination choice model, and then apply that model to examine utility-based park accessibility and equity. 2.2 Access to Parks, Grocery Stores, and Libraries Parks and other open spaces are frequently understood to provide mental and physical health benefits to the members of the community who use them (Bedimo-Rung et al., 2005), but specific evidence of a link between access and these benefits is somewhat mixed, perhaps due to a wide variety of accessibility measures used in various studies (Bancroft et al., 2015). Most use some form of isochrone-based measure. For example, Neusel Ussery et al. (2016) developed a county-level green space density measure for the entire United States based on the percentage of developed green space in each county. A popular measure called ParkScore (Trust for Public Land, 2019) uses the share of a population that lives within a 10-minute walk of a park to provide a metropolitan-level accessibility score. Some studies have shown that metropolitan areas with a higher ParkScore have better health outcomes (Rigolon et al., 2018), but this finding has not been satisfactorily reproduced for neighborhoods within a metropolitan region. Kaczynski et al. (2016) developed ParkIndex, a measure that gives extra weight to neighborhoods near high-quality parks by incorporating park choice preferences determined from a user survey; some of the usefulness of this measure is limited by only weighting neighborhoods within 1 mile of a park rather than being applied continuously across the region as a utility-based access measure. Macfarlane et al. (2020) constructed a utility-based access to parks measure derived from an earlier park choice survey (Kinnell et al., 2006), and showed a positive relationship between this measure and health outcomes that does not appear to exist when using the ParkScore isochrone access measure. The accessibility of grocery stores to low-income or other disadvantaged communities has been a similarly frequent topic in the academic literature; both in terms of identifying the existence of so-called “food deserts” as well as correlating these deserts with measures of well-being. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines food deserts for their own purposes as low-income census tracts where a certain threshold of people live more than a mile from the nearest grocery store, or a shorter threshold if automobile ownership is low (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2021). Most other researchers have adopted similar definitions of access. For example, Morland et al. (2002) use the number of grocery stores in the same census tract, Algert et al. (2006) used the share of households within 0.8 kilometers of a store, and Hamidi (2020) uses the USDA measures directly. In conflict with these simplistic definitions are a number of studies suggesting that the nearest grocery store is not necessarily where people — including low-income people — obtain their food (Aggarwal et al., 2014; Clifton, 2004; Recker and Kostyniuk, 1978). Wood and Horner (2016) addressed this shortcoming by considering a gravity-derived accessibility measure, weighting the number of opportunities against a continuous travel time function. Other more recent research has suggested that what matters is not home accessibility as much as location of a store within a time-space construction of a person’s daily activities (Chen and Yeh, 2021; Widener et al., 2015). Libraries provide important educational and social opportunities for community members through computer facilities, reference materials, and special programs (Barclay, 2017; Maxwell, 2008). Libraries can also be used to enhance physical and emotional well-being in a community through public initiatives (Philbin et al., 2019). Though perhaps not as commonly studied as either parks or libraries, a few recent efforts have examined the spatial distribution of libraries and socioeconomic disparities in access. Allen (2019) measured the gap in travel time to the nearest library by car and by public transit, showing that transit-dependent communities were considerably disadvantaged. Cheng et al. (2021) applied travel time thresholds to examine the share of communities in Hong Kong that lacked access. Guo et al. (2017) also measured library access disparities in Hong Kong, using two different travel-time focused measures. None of the measures we could find considered other attributes of the library beyond its proximity, even though these addtional features play a strong role in the library’s role in community building (Barclay, 2017). Certainly there are other community resources that warrant consideration; Ermagun and Tilahun (2020) consider a multiple-resource gravity accessibility measure that includes schools, jobs, and hospitals in addition to the three that have been used here. Churches, museums, or various other facilities might be relevant elements in shaping the quality of life in a community. Regardless of what resources are selected, it is clear that existing accessibility practice considers spatial proximity as paramount, and quality of the destination as secondary. Further, travel times by particular modes are the default measure rather than holistic, multimodal travel impedance measures. Using utility-based measures for both travel impedance and for the accessibility measure might provide a more complete picture of who can and who cannot access community resources in a region.
